# Monty Hall Problem
Basic Monty Hall problem prover, using python built in random function, you pick a number of times to open the "doors" and it will try the amount by either switching or not

It will output 2 numbers, first one the amount of times you lost and second the amount of times you won.

Input taken as:

                1000
                True

This will open the doors 100 times and always switch
